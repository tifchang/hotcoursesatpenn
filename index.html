      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Course registration is a stressful time for students at Penn. Whether it's trying to strike the
        balance between work load, difficulty, and quality, or weighing the probabilities of getting into a
        course when ranking them, students spend needless hours stressing over issues around registration rather
        than their academics. I hope this analysis provides you insights around student reviews and demands
        around courses at Penn and maybe even ease your selection and registration processes.

      <h2>Sources</h2>
      <p>
        There are two datasets in this project: Penn Course Review and Penn Course Alert data sets.
        The Penn Course Review data was pulled from the <a href="http://pennlabs.org/docs/pcr.html">
          Penn Course Review API</a>. As a member of Penn Labs, I was able to get access to the
          <a href="penncoursealert.com">Penn Course Alert</a> data, which consists of data from
          requests made by students through the PCA service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Penn Course Review data provides insights on a course, listed by semester, year, and professor,
        through reviews and ratings provided by students at the end of the semester. The API returns a JSON
        that consists of this information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Penn Course Alert provides a notification service to students regarding when a closed course becomes available.
        Students sign up to get notified via text or email. The data PCA collects is the number of times students
        request to get notified for a specific course. This can be used as a proxy for how in-demand a course is.
        Added to the PCA data to help with the visualization was a table of departments by school. I collected this data
        through Penn's academic curriculum portion of their website. I copy and pasted these values into a table in my
        PCA data set to then use a <code>VLOOKUP</code> to correspond departments to schools for each course.

      <h2>Project</h2>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        As a student at Penn, I wanted to get a deeper understanding of what makes a course "hot", and therefore
        becomes in such high demand that students are still trying to get in post advanced registration. Through the
        two data sets I have, I wanted to dive deeper into what these courses are, what drives their demand, and hopefully
        provide some conclusions that will be insightful for future course selection processes. <br />
        My initial hypothesis is that courses that are ranked very low in course work or
        difficulty, courses taught by highly ranked professors, low capacity, are core courses, or courses with high quality will
        surface as the courses students make requests through PCA for. <br />
        The data used in this analysis is 2018 Spring PCA data and 2016 Spring PCR data (the last time PCR was updated). I wanted to
        match the semesters as best as possible and aimed to select data from similar semesters.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer-1"></div>
      <h4>Collecting &amp; Cleaning</h4>
      <p>
        The dataset was a bit tricky to collect and clean. First, I identified the courses that students made requests
        for as the sample I wanted to focus on. After getting that data from MongoDB using <code>mongodump</code> and converting BSON to JSON,
        I cleaned the course queries since there wasn't sufficient error handling in the form (some queries produced incorrect
        course codes that would result in an error when using that to pull PCR data). Furthermore, I used a pivot table
        to aggregate course sections into one count value per course. <br />

        Then, I loaded the course identifiers
        into an array for which I wrote a script that pulled data for each one of the courses listed in PCA (script can
        be found on my <a href="http://www.github.com/tifchang/oidd215_proj1">Github</a>). From there, I converted my JSON
        file into a CSV file, for which I was able to clean and parse through using Excel and combine with the PCA data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the data was well structured, I loaded it into Tableau with an inner join on course code, and created visualizations
        that best surfaced reasons behind highly demanded courses.

      <br />
      <p>
        Grouping the courses by school and defining the size by the number of requests made for a specific course
        surfaces a common trend across highly demanded courses. Courses like <code>MKTG-101</code>, <code>MGMT-101</code>,
        <code>BEPP-250</code>, &amp; <code>MKTG-101</code> are courses in the core Wharton curriculum. Courses like <code>MATH-114</code>,
        <code>ECON-002</code>, &amp; <code>PSYC-170</code> are introduction and prerequisite courses, required across majors
        not only in the college. <br />
        During the spring semester, seniors graduating needing to fulfill core requirements or underclassmen (freshmen) looking to take prerequisites
        for upper level courses could be the primary users driving the influx of demand. These motives are time sensitive.
      </p> <br />
      <div class="notification is-link" >
        ⚠️ <b>Recommendation:</b>
        When ranking courses for advanced registration, be mindful of core and prerequisite classes and reference this visual to
        see which core courses may be more difficult to get into. Since this may also be a time sensitive issue (your academic
        schedule would be set back if you didn't get into the course), be sure to rank a core class you want to get into near the top.
      </div>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <p><b>Demand by Capacity</b></p> <br />
      <div class="viz">
          <script type='text/javascript' src='https://us-west-2b.online.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'></script><div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 98%; height: 820px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='98%' height='820px' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fus-west-2b.online.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;coursedemandatpenn' /><param name='name' value='numreqpercourse&#47;DemandbyCapacity' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='no' /><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' /><param name='filter' value='iframeSizedToWindow=true' /></object></div>
      </div>
        <br />
      <p>
        I calculated Demand (d) by taking the ratio of requests to the capacity of the course. Since you can only
        make requests to get notified if the course is closed, we can already assume that there is exceeding demand
        for these courses. However, diving into the demand, I created four levels of demand to show the gradient
        of demand: Low (0.005 ≤ d < 0.5), Medium (0.5 ≤ d < 1), High (1 ≤ d < 3), Super High (3 ≤ d < 4).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing we notice is that most of the requests were made for courses with low capacities, as points
        aggregate near the origin. Considering points near the origin, as well as points with large counts of
        requests, we notice that those are the higher demanded courses. Once again, we see required classes surfacing
        such as <code>WRIT-002</code>, which is Writing Seminar. Its capacity is very low with 10 seats and is in
        high demand with 67 students trying to get in.
      </p> <br />
        <div class="notification is-link" >
          ⚠️ <b>Recommendation:</b>
          Be mindful of small courses with low capacities. They are more difficult to get into simply by chance of getting
          one of the few seats. When ranking your courses, place smaller classes at the top. This does not include the
          size of recitations but specifically regarding the entire course's size.
        </div>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <p><b>Demand by Instructor Quality &amp; Difficulty</b></p> <br />
      <div class="viz">
        <script type='text/javascript' src='https://us-west-2b.online.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'></script><div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 98%; height: 755px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='98%' height='755' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fus-west-2b.online.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;coursedemandatpenn' /><param name='name' value='numreqpercourse&#47;Sheet3' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='no' /><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' /><param name='filter' value='iframeSizedToWindow=true' /></object></div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        Most courses requested have professors that are above average. In the visual, this is denoted by most of the points aggregating
        above the average Instructor Quality line. It is sensible that students would want to be taking classes with quality
        professors. However, I wanted to also add some dimension with students rating professors highly because of course difficulty
        and their overall experience tainting their accurate assessment of the instructor's quality. Therefore, I added a color
        dimension that helped group instructors based off the difficulty of their course as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difficulty seems to be dispersed evenly across all instructor qualities. Therefore, we can focus in on the instructor's
        quality and note that students tend to make more requests for higher rated professors. We can see here that courses like
        <code>MKTG-476/776</code> surface, which are not prerequisites or core classes but are courses with highly rated professors, in
        this case Peter Fader at 3.7.
      </p> <br />
      <div class="notification is-link" >
        ⚠️ <b>Recommendation:</b>
        If the professor is rated highly, the course could have significant demand. However, in comparison to the previous two parameters,
        professor quality is not as strong of a driver as course requirement and capacity.

      <h4>Disclaimers &amp; Looking Forward</h4> <br />
      <p>
        The data I used for PCA was the first round of collection since the product was built and released in late fall of 2017
        when advanced registration opened. Therefore, the data is not perfect and can only give a rough glimpse at the motives
        behind course selection at Penn. This data does not account for the same person making recurring requests for one courses
        since new requests overwrite old requests. Furthermore, I could not account for requests to recitations versus lectures or
        if students were already in a course but simply wanted to switch sections. However, this type of behavior as well as the
        simple fact that there are a lot of students that are dissatisfied with their courses and want to get into other courses
        yields the potential of building products that allow students to swap courses, recitations, lectures and more in order to
        meet the supply and demands of courses, as students occasionally will need to drop a course to add another.
